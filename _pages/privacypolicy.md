# Privacy Policy for Mura

**Effective Date:** 22 August 2025

Mura is built as a private journaling space. Your entries belong to you, and we are committed to protecting your privacy.

## 1. Information We Collect

- **Journal Entries**  
  Your journal entries are stored **only on your device**. We do not have access to them. They are never uploaded to our servers.

- **App Usage Data**  
  We may collect anonymous app usage and crash data (via Firebase) to improve stability and performance. This data does not include your journal entries.

- **Subscription & Purchases**  
  We use RevenueCat to process in-app purchases and manage subscriptions. RevenueCat receives basic information from Apple / Google necessary to confirm your purchase (e.g., transaction ID, subscription status). We do not receive your payment details.

- **AI Features**  
  If you use Muraâ€™s AI-powered features (e.g., to generate prompts or reflections), the text you enter into these features is sent to **OpenAI** to generate a response.  
  - Your journal entries are **never automatically sent** to OpenAI.  
  - Only the text you choose to provide for AI features is shared.  
  - OpenAI may temporarily store this data for abuse monitoring, but it is not used to train their models.
