# **🌿 Mura 1.0 — Our First Step Together**
We’re so excited to introduce Mura, your new space for gentle reflection and daily journaling. ✨

This first release is all about keeping things simple, private, and meaningful:

🖋️ Daily Prompts to spark your thoughts

🔒 Private by Default — your words stay safely on your devic

🌱 Minimalist Design that keeps the focus on you

🤖 AI Companion to guide and inspire, only when you want it

⏰ Gentle Reminders to help you build a lasting habit

Mura is the easiest way to start building your legacy — one prompt, one thought, one day at a time. 💫

Thank you for being here from the very beginning. This is just the start, and we can’t wait to grow Mura together.
